# MakeupCorrector

You see, I might be a Computer scientist, but I also happen to be a woman. And I truly, truly hate spending more than ten minutes to fix this mess called "my face" every morning, especially if I need to combine several products together because *I just can't find the right concealer for my skin tone*. These few lines of code do two useful things:

 * Compute the average RGB color corresponding to my dark circles so that I can finally know what I'm dealing with;
 * Compute the complementary color of my dark circles, so that I can finally know how to possibly correct them.
 
 One way or another *I shall destroy you, dark circles*.
